NAND FLASH MARKET FACES STRUCTURAL UNDERSUPPLY IN 2026
Market Forecast | TrendForce | January 5, 2026

The NAND flash market is entering a period of structural undersupply in 2026, with demand growth (20-22%) significantly outpacing capacity expansion (15-17%). This imbalance is driving substantial price increases and reshaping the storage market landscape.

SUPPLY-DEMAND DYNAMICS:

Capacity Growth: +15-17% (2026 vs. 2025)
Demand Growth: +20-22% (2026 vs. 2025)
Result: Structural undersupply throughout 2026

Price Forecast:
- Full year 2026: +20-30% average
- Q1 2026: +33-38% QoQ
- Enterprise SSD: Steeper increases due to tight supply
- Client SSD: +40%+ QoQ despite weaker notebook demand

PRIMARY DEMAND DRIVERS:

1. Enterprise SSD Surge:
- Becoming largest NAND application segment in 2026
- AI datacenter demand accelerating
- HDD shortages forcing migration to high-capacity QLC SSDs
- Cloud service providers securing capacity aggressively

2. AI Infrastructure:
- AI servers requiring significantly more storage per system
- Training datasets growing exponentially
- Inference workloads demanding low-latency storage

3. Capacity Reallocation:
- Manufacturers reducing lower-margin products (MLC NAND down 41.7% YoY)
- Focus on higher-margin enterprise/datacenter segments
- Samsung reducing SATA SSD production

MANUFACTURER STRATEGIES:

Disciplined Capacity Expansion:
- Memory makers cautious after 2022 downturn
- Prioritizing profitability over market share
- Some manufacturers (SK Hynix) reportedly sold out for 2026

Technology Transitions:
- Kioxia: 332-layer BiCS10 ramping H2 2026
- Samsung: Advancing high-layer-count V-NAND
- Micron: Next-gen 3D NAND development
- Focus on density improvements vs. raw capacity additions

SEGMENT-SPECIFIC OUTLOOK:

Enterprise SSDs:
- Tightest supply conditions
- Datacenter/AI demand pulling capacity
- Price increases exceeding 40% in some segments
- OEMs securing long-term supply agreements

Client SSDs:
- Paradox: Weak notebook demand but rising prices
- Suppliers reallocating capacity to enterprise segment
- Consumer impact: Higher SSD costs in PCs despite soft demand

MLC NAND:
- Severe supply reduction (41.7% YoY capacity decline)
- Industrial/automotive segments facing shortages
- Price premiums for remaining MLC supply

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

For OEMs:
- Supply security becoming competitive advantage
- Need for diversified supplier relationships
- Long-term contracts vs. spot market volatility

For Storage Solution Providers:
- Pricing power in tight market
- Opportunity for value-added solutions (controllers, software)
- Risk of demand destruction if prices rise too high

For End Users:
- Higher PC/server costs
- Potential for specification downgrades
- Increased interest in storage optimization technologies

DURATION OUTLOOK:

The undersupply condition is expected to persist through 2026 and potentially into 2027. Unlike cyclical shortages, this represents a structural shift driven by:
- AI infrastructure build-out (multi-year trend)
- Manufacturer discipline on capacity
- Technology transition complexities

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES:

The tight supply environment creates opportunities for:
- Companies with guaranteed NAND access (e.g., via partnerships)
- Storage efficiency technologies (compression, deduplication)
- Alternative architectures (tiered storage, hybrid solutions)
