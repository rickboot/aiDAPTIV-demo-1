KIOXIA ACCELERATES 332-LAYER NAND PRODUCTION FOR AI DEMAND
Industry Report | Tom's Hardware | January 5, 2026

Kioxia Corporation announced plans to begin mass production of its 10th-generation 3D NAND flash memory (BiCS10) at its Kitakami plant in Japan during 2026, targeting the surging demand from AI data centers.

TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICATIONS:

BiCS10 (332-layer):
- 59% higher storage density vs. previous generation
- Data transfer speeds: Up to 4.8 Gb/s (33% improvement)
- CMOS Directly Bonded to Array (CBA) architecture
- 8-bit Toggle DDR 6.0 interface

BiCS9 (218-layer):
- Also ramping in 2026
- Same CBA architecture and interface technology
- Targeting mainstream enterprise and consumer segments

MARKET POSITIONING:

The accelerated production timeline reflects Kioxia's strategic response to NAND market dynamics:

1. AI Datacenter Demand: Enterprise SSDs becoming largest NAND segment in 2026
2. HDD Shortages: Data centers adopting high-capacity QLC SSDs as HDD alternatives
3. Supply Discipline: Industry-wide caution on capacity expansion maintaining pricing power

PARTNERSHIP ECOSYSTEM:

Kioxia maintains strategic relationships with leading SSD controller developers:
- Phison Electronics (also a shareholder in Phison)
- Western Digital (joint venture partner)
- Major OEMs for enterprise and consumer products

The company previously recognized Phison with an "Outstanding Supplier Performance Award" for ongoing collaboration on NAND controller development.

SUPPLY OUTLOOK:

Industry analysts note Kioxia's production ramp comes amid broader NAND market tightness:
- Q1 2026 NAND prices forecast to rise 33-38% QoQ
- Enterprise SSD demand outpacing supply
- Client SSD prices also increasing despite weaker notebook demand

The 332-layer technology positions Kioxia competitively against:
- Samsung (pursuing similar high-layer-count roadmap)
- Micron (advancing 3D NAND generations)
- SK Hynix (focused on HBM, reducing NAND emphasis)

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

Kioxia's investment in cutting-edge NAND production provides strategic advantages to partners:

For Phison Electronics:
- Access to leading-edge NAND technology
- Supply security amid market tightness
- Joint optimization of controllers for new NAND generations

For OEMs:
- Guaranteed component availability through Kioxia partnership network
- Performance leadership with latest NAND + controller combinations

PRODUCTION TIMELINE:

BiCS9 (218-layer): Mass production Q1-Q2 2026
BiCS10 (332-layer): Mass production H2 2026
Next-gen development: Ongoing (BiCS11 targeting 400+ layers)

ANALYST PERSPECTIVE:

"Kioxia's aggressive NAND roadmap execution strengthens its position in the AI storage market," notes TrendForce. "Partners with access to Kioxia's advanced NAND gain competitive advantages in supply security and performance."

The production ramp also signals Kioxia's confidence in sustained NAND demand despite cyclical market concerns.
