SAMSUNG ADVANCES AI SSD STRATEGY WITH PM9E1 CONTROLLER
Press Release | Samsung Semiconductor | January 6, 2026

Samsung Electronics announced its PM9E1 PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD featuring a 5nm-based in-house controller optimized for AI workloads in on-device AI PCs. The announcement positions Samsung as a direct competitor in the emerging AI PC storage market.

PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS:

PM9E1 SSD:
- PCIe 5.0 x4 NVMe interface
- 5nm controller design (in-house development)
- Power efficiency optimized for mobile AI workloads
- Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM) v1.2
- Secure channel, device authentication, firmware attestation

Performance Targets:
- Sequential read: 14.5 GB/s
- Sequential write: 13.0 GB/s
- Random IOPS: 3.0M+ (optimized for AI data patterns)

AI-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:

Mixed Workload Handling:
- Parallel data path processing for complex AI read/write patterns
- Intelligent write buffering for training workloads
- Quality-of-Service (QoS) features to prevent I/O starvation

Thermal Management:
- Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
- Advanced thermal throttling algorithms
- Designed for dense AI server deployments

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:

Samsung's vertical integration strategy (own NAND + controllers) enables:
- Deep optimization between controller and V-NAND technology
- Supply chain control amid component shortages
- Faster time-to-market for new technologies

The PM9E1 competes directly with:
- Phison E26-based solutions (Corsair, Seagate, etc.)
- Silicon Motion MonTitan platform
- Marvell enterprise controllers

MARKET STRATEGY:

Samsung is shifting production capacity from lower-margin SATA SSDs toward higher-margin AI-focused products, according to industry sources. This strategic pivot reflects:
- AI workload demand growth
- Memory/storage pricing power in AI segment
- Competitive pressure in traditional SSD markets

The company's Memory Solutions Lab (MSL) is actively researching:
- CXL memory fabric integration
- AI memory architectures
- Hardware-software co-design for next-gen AI solutions

ANALYST PERSPECTIVE:

"Samsung's in-house controller development gives them unique advantages," notes Blocks & Files. "However, Phison's ecosystem approach (partnering with multiple NAND makers and OEMs) provides flexibility that vertical integration can't match."

The AI SSD market is becoming increasingly competitive as memory constraints drive demand for storage-based memory extension solutions.

AVAILABILITY:

PM9E1: Q2 2026 (OEM partnerships)
Consumer variants: H2 2026

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

For Phison:
- Direct competitive threat in AI SSD segment
- Need to emphasize ecosystem advantages and aiDAPTIV+ software differentiation
- Opportunity to highlight multi-source NAND flexibility vs. Samsung's single-source approach

For OEMs:
- More vendor options for AI PC storage
- Potential for competitive pricing pressure
- Need to evaluate controller capabilities vs. total solution value
