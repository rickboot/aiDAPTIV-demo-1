POST:
Anyone tried SSD offloading for LLM inference? Running out of VRAM options here.

TOP COMMENTS:
u/dev_help: 'Same issue here. 32GB isn't enough for Llama-3-70B.'
u/ai_researcher: 'KV cache is the problem. You need 100GB+ for 128k context.'
u/hardware_guru: 'This is why SSD offloading is becoming popular.'

ANALYSIS:
Developer community expressing frustration with VRAM limitations. Llama-3-70B requires 100GB+ but most GPUs only have 32GB. Strong signal for memory offloading solutions.
