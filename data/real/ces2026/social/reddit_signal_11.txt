POST:
Why is AMD not addressing the memory bottleneck? Qwen2.5-72B needs 100GB but most GPUs only have 80GB.

TOP COMMENTS:
u/dev_help: 'Same issue here. 80GB isn't enough for Qwen2.5-72B.'
u/ai_researcher: 'KV cache is the problem. You need 100GB+ for 1024k context.'
u/hardware_guru: 'This is why SSD offloading is becoming popular.'

ANALYSIS:
Developer community expressing frustration with VRAM limitations. Qwen2.5-72B requires 100GB+ but most GPUs only have 80GB. Strong signal for memory offloading solutions.
