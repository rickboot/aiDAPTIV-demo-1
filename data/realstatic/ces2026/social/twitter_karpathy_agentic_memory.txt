Agentic workflows are memory-hungry beasts. 

The problem: context windows growing faster than VRAM capacity. Every agent needs to maintain state, tool outputs, reasoning chains... it adds up FAST.

We're seeing 100K+ token contexts becoming standard. That's 50-80GB of KV cache for a 70B model. 

This will be THE bottleneck of 2026. 🧵

@karpathy
Not just inference either. Fine-tuning with long contexts? Forget about it on consumer hardware.

Cloud solutions exist (obviously) but:
- Privacy concerns for sensitive data
- Latency for real-time apps
- Cost at scale

We need better local memory architectures.

@karpathy
Interesting approaches I'm watching:
1. Quantized KV cache (quality trade-offs)
2. Sparse attention (works for some use cases)
3. Tiered memory systems (SSD offload, etc.)
4. Model compression (but you lose capability)

None are perfect. We're in an awkward transition period.

@karpathy
The irony: We finally have models smart enough to be truly useful agents, but we can't run them locally because of memory constraints.

Cloud providers love this. Local AI advocates... not so much.

@karpathy
Prediction: By end of 2026, we'll see specialized hardware for context memory management. Either from GPU vendors or storage companies.

The market opportunity is too big to ignore.

This is why I'm skeptical of "AI PC" marketing. 16GB RAM isn't going to cut it for serious agentic workflows.

@karpathy
Exactly. The spec sheets don't match the use case requirements.

@HardwareEngineer
Have you looked at CXL memory expansion? Seems promising for this exact problem.

@karpathy
Interesting tech but still expensive and not widely available. Need solutions that work with today's hardware.

@StartupFounder
Our API bills for Claude/GPT-4 are $40K/month. Would LOVE a local solution but can't sacrifice quality.

@karpathy
This is the real tension. Cloud quality is high, but costs scale linearly with usage. Local has upfront costs but better unit economics at scale.

@karpathy We're working on SSD-based memory offload solutions for exactly this use case. Would love to discuss further. DM open.

The fact that a storage company is replying to this thread tells you everything about where the market is heading.
