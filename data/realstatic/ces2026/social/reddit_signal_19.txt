POST:
Is 24GB VRAM enough for Mixtral-8x7B? Getting crashes during inference.

TOP COMMENTS:
u/dev_help: 'Same issue here. 24GB isn't enough for Mixtral-8x7B.'
u/ai_researcher: 'KV cache is the problem. You need 60GB+ for 256k context.'
u/hardware_guru: 'This is why SSD offloading is becoming popular.'

ANALYSIS:
Developer community expressing frustration with VRAM limitations. Mixtral-8x7B requires 60GB+ but most GPUs only have 24GB. Strong signal for memory offloading solutions.
