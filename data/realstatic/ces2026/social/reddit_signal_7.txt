POST:
Why is Intel not addressing the memory bottleneck? Mixtral-8x7B needs 40GB but most GPUs only have 32GB.

TOP COMMENTS:
u/dev_help: 'Same issue here. 32GB isn't enough for Mixtral-8x7B.'
u/ai_researcher: 'KV cache is the problem. You need 40GB+ for 1024k context.'
u/hardware_guru: 'This is why SSD offloading is becoming popular.'

ANALYSIS:
Developer community expressing frustration with VRAM limitations. Mixtral-8x7B requires 40GB+ but most GPUs only have 32GB. Strong signal for memory offloading solutions.
