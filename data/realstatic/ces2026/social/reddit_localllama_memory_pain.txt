r/LocalLLaMA - "24GB is NOT enough anymore - here's my pain"
Posted by u/AIEnthusiast2026 | 847 upvotes | 312 comments

Title says it all. I've been running local LLMs on my RTX 4090 (24GB) for the past year and I'm hitting walls constantly now.

WHAT CHANGED:

December 2024: Could run Llama 2 70B quantized (Q4) comfortably
January 2026: Llama 3.1 70B barely fits, Qwen 2.5 72B OOMs constantly

The problem isn't just model size - it's CONTEXT LENGTH. Everyone's pushing for longer contexts now:
- Gemma 2 27B: 128K context (my 4090 can't handle it)
- Mistral Large: 128K context (forget about it)
- Even Llama 3.1 8B with full 128K context uses 18GB+ VRAM

KV CACHE IS EATING MY LUNCH:

For those who don't know: the KV cache grows QUADRATICALLY with context length. Double your context = 4x the VRAM for cache.

My actual numbers running Llama 3.1 70B Q4:
- 8K context: 22GB VRAM (fits!)
- 32K context: OOM crash
- 128K context: not even close

WORKAROUNDS I'VE TRIED:

1. Offloading to RAM: Works but SLOW. Like 2-3 tokens/sec instead of 25 t/s
2. Quantizing KV cache (Q8_0): Saves maybe 15% VRAM, quality hit noticeable
3. Flash Attention: Helps a bit but doesn't solve the fundamental problem
4. Smaller models: Defeats the purpose, quality suffers

THE REAL ISSUE:

Cloud AI is gobbling up all the HBM production. Good luck finding an RTX 5090 (rumored 32GB) at MSRP when it launches. Scalpers gonna scalp.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is selling H100s with 80GB HBM to datacenters for $30K each. They don't care about us.

WHAT I ACTUALLY NEED:

- 48GB VRAM minimum for serious local LLM work
- Or some way to offload KV cache to fast storage without killing performance
- Or just cheaper RAM/VRAM (lol not happening in 2026)

Anyone else hitting these limits? What are you doing about it?

u/VRAMStruggler (+203):
Same boat. I'm seriously considering just paying for Claude API at this point. My electricity bill + hardware depreciation is approaching cloud costs anyway.

u/QuantizationKing (+187):
Have you tried the new Adaptive-Quant? Claims 75% memory reduction. I'm skeptical but might be worth a shot.

u/SSDOffloadExperiment (+156):
I've been experimenting with offloading KV cache to a Gen5 NVMe SSD. It's not as slow as RAM offload (getting 8-10 t/s on 70B models). The trick is using a high-endurance drive and optimizing the cache eviction policy.

Check out this project: github.com/kvcache-ssd (not my repo)

u/AIEnthusiast2026 (OP):
@SSDOffloadExperiment - Interesting! What SSD are you using? I have a Samsung 990 Pro but haven't tried this approach.

u/SSDOffloadExperiment:
Phison E26-based drive (Corsair MP700). Sequential read is 12GB/s which helps. Still experimenting but it's way better than system RAM offload.

u/CloudSkeptic (+134):
This is exactly why I'm bullish on edge AI solutions. The cloud-first narrative ignores:
- Privacy (can't send medical/legal data to OpenAI)
- Latency (real-time apps need local inference)  
- Cost (API bills add up FAST for production use)

But we need better local memory solutions. Current hardware isn't cutting it.

u/HardwareRealist (+98):
The memory wall is real. Jensen Huang literally said "memory shortages will persist through 2026" at CES yesterday. 

We're in a supercycle where AI demand > memory supply. Prices aren't coming down anytime soon.

u/PragmaticDev (+76):
Unpopular opinion: Most people don't need to run 70B models locally. A well-tuned 13B model handles 90% of use cases.

u/AIEnthusiast2026 (OP):
@PragmaticDev - Fair point for general use, but I'm doing domain-specific fine-tuning. 70B models are significantly better for my use case (legal document analysis). Quality matters.
