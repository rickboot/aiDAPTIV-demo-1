Welcome to the stage, Nvidia founder and CEO, Jensen Wong.

[Music] [Applause]
3:40
Hello, Las Vegas. Happy New Year.
3:45
Welcome to CES. Well, we have about 15 keynotes worth of
3:51
material to pack in here. I'm so happy to see all of you. You got 3,000 people in this auditorium. There's 2,000 people
3:58
in a courtyard watching us. There's another thousand people apparently in the fourth floor where there were
4:03
supposed to be Nvidia show floors all watching this keynote and of course millions around the world are going to
4:08
be watching this to kick off this new year. Well, every 10 to 15 years the
4:15
computer industry resets. A new platform shift happens
4:22
from mainframe to PC, PC to internet, internet to cloud, cloud to mobile. Each
4:27
time the world of applications target a new platform, that's why it's
4:34
called a platform shift. You write new applications for a new computer.
4:39
Except this time, there are two simultaneous platform shifts in fact happening at the same
4:45
time. While we now move to AI, applications
4:51
are now going to be built on top of AI. At first, people thought AIs are applications. And in fact, AIS are
4:58
applications, but you're going to build applications on top of AIS.
5:03
But in addition to that, how you run the software, how you
5:09
develop the software fundamentally changed. The entire five
5:15
stack of the computer industry is being reinvented. You no longer program the software, you
5:22
train the software. You don't run it on CPUs, you run it on GPUs.
5:28
And whereas applications were pre-recorded, pre-ompiled
5:34
and run on your device, now applications understand the context and generate
5:40
every single pixel, every single token completely from scratch every single time.
5:46
Computing has been fundamentally reshaped as a result of accelerated computing, as a result of artificial
5:52
intelligence. Every single layer of that five layer cake is now being re
5:57
reinvented. Well, what that means is some 10 trillion dollars or so of the
6:03
last decade of computing is now being modernized to this new way of doing computing. What that means is hundreds
6:11
of billions of dollars, a couple hundred billion dollars in VC funding each year is going into modernize and inventing
6:18
this new world. And what it means is a hundred trillion dollars of industry,
6:23
several percent of which is R&D budget is shifting over to artificial intelligence. People ask where is the
6:30
money coming from? That's where the money is coming from. the modernization of AI to AI, the shifting of R&D budgets
6:39
from classical methods to now artificial intelligence methods. Enormous amounts
6:44
of investments coming into this industry, which explains why we're so busy. And this last year was no
6:50
difference. This last year was incredible. This last year, there's a slide coming.
6:57
This is what happens when you don't practice. It's the first keynote of the year. I
7:03
hope it's your first keynote of the year. Otherwise, you can you have been pretty pretty busy. It's our first keynote of the year. We're going to get
7:09
the spiderw webs out. And so 2025 was an
7:14
incredible year. It's just see it seems like everything was happening all at the same time and it in fact it probably
7:20
was. The first thing of course is scaling loss.
7:25
In 2015, the first language model that I thought
7:31
was really going to make a difference made a huge difference. It was called BERT. 2017, Transformers came. It wasn't
7:38
until 5 years later, 2022, that Chad GPT moment happened and it awakened the
7:44
world to the possibilities of artificial intelligence. Something very important happened a year
7:49
after that. The first 01 model from chat GPT the first reasoning model completely
7:56
revolutionary invented this idea called test time scaling which is very common sens common sensical thing not only do
8:04
we pre-train a model to learn we postrain it with our re reinforcement learning so that it could learn skills
8:10
and now we also have test time scaling which is another way of saying thinking you think in real time each one of these
8:18
phases of artificial intelligence requires enormous amount of compute and the computing law continued to scale.
8:24
Large language models continued to get better. Meanwhile, another breakthrough happened and this breakthrough happened
8:31
in 2024. Agentic systems starting to emerge in 2025. It started to pervase to to uh
8:39
proliferate just about everywhere. Agentic models that have the ability to reason,
8:45
look up information, do research, use tools, plan futures, simulate outcomes.
8:53
All of a sudden started to solve very, very important problems. One of my favorite Agentic models is called
9:00
cursor, which revolutionized the way we do software programming at NVIDIA. Agentic systems are going to really take
9:06
off from here. Of course, there were other types of AI. We know that large language models isn't the only type of
9:12
information. Wherever the universe has information, wherever the universe has structure, we could teach a large
9:19
language model a form of language model to go understand that information to
9:26
understand its representation and to turn that into an AI. One of the biggest
9:31
most important one is physical AI. AIs that understand the laws of nature. And
9:37
then of course physical AI is about AI interacting with the world. But the
9:42
world itself has information encoded information and that's called AI physics. AI that in the case of physical
9:50
AI you have AI that interacts with the physical world and you have AI physics. AI that understands the laws of physics.
9:57
And then lastly one of the most important things that happened last year the advancement of open models. We can
10:05
now know that AI is going to proliferate everywhere when open source when open
10:10
innovation when innovation across every single company and every industry around the world is activated. At the same
10:16
time, open models really took off last year. In fact, last year we saw the
10:25
advance of Deepseek R1, the first open model that's a reasoning system. It
10:32
caught the world by surprise and it activated literally this entire
10:38
movement. Really, really exciting work. We're so happy with it. Now we have
10:44
opening open model systems all over the world of all different kinds and we now know that open models have also reached
10:51
the frontier. still solidly is six months behind the frontier models but
10:56
every single six months a new model is emerging and these models are getting
11:01
smarter and smarter because of that you could see the number of downloads has
11:07
exploded the number of downloads is growing so fast because startups want to
11:13
participate in the AI revolution large companies want to researchers want to students want to just about every single
11:20
country wants How is it possible that intelligence the digital form of intelligence will leave
11:26
anyone behind and so open models has really revolutionized
11:32
artificial intelligence last year. This entire industry is going to be reshaped as a result of that. Now we had this
11:38
inkling some time ago. You might have heard that several years ago we started
11:44
to build and operate our own AI supercomputers. We call them DGX clouds. A lot of people asked, are you going to
11:51
in going into the cloud business? The answer is no. We're building these DGX supercomputers for our own use. Well, it
11:58
turns out we have billions of dollars of supercomputers in operation so that we
12:04
could develop our open models. I am so pleased with the work that we're doing.
12:09
It is starting to attract attention all over the world and all over the industries because we are doing frontier
12:15
AI model work in so many different domains. The work that we did in proteins in digital biology. La protina
12:23
to be able to synthesize and generate proteins. Open fold 3 to understand the
12:28
understand the structure of proteins. EVO 2 how to understand and generate
12:35
multiple proteins otherwise the beginnings of cellular cellular representation. Earth 2 AI that
12:42
understands laws of physics. The work that we did with forecast net, the work that we did with Cordiff really
12:48
revolutionized the way that people are doing weather prediction. Neotron,
12:54
we've now doing groundbreaking work there. The first hybrid transformer SSM
12:59
model that's incredibly fast can and therefore can think for a very long time
13:05
or can think very quickly with that for not a very long time and produce very very smart intelligent answers.
13:11
Neimotron 3 is groundbreaking work and you can expect us to deliver other versions of Neimotron 3 in the near
13:17
future. Cosmos a frontier open world foundation model
13:24
one that understand how the world works. Groot a humanoid robotic system
13:29
articulation mobility locomotion. These models, these technologies are now being
13:36
integrated and in the each one of these cases open to the world. Frontier human
13:41
or robotics models open to the world. And then today we're going to talk a little bit about Alpa Mayo, the work
13:46
that we've been doing in self-driving cars. Not only do we open source the models, we also open source the data
13:54
that we use to train those models because that in that way only in that
13:59
way can you truly trust how the models came to be. We open source all the
14:04
models. We help you make derivatives from them. We have a whole suite of libraries we call the Nemo libraries,
14:11
physics li physics nemo libraries and the claim libraries. Each biono
14:16
libraries. Each one of these libraries are life cycle management systems of AIS so that you could process the data, you
14:23
could generate data, you could train the model, you could create the model, evaluate the model, guardrail the model
14:28
all the way to deploying the model. Each one of these libraries are incredibly complex and all of it is open sourced.
14:35
And so now on top of this platform, NVIDIA is a frontier AI model builder
14:42
and we build it in a very special way. We build it completely in the open so
14:47
that we can enable every company, every industry, every country to be part of
14:52
this AI revolution. I'm incredibly proud of the work that we're doing there. In fact, if you notice the tren the charts,
14:59
the chart shows that our contribution to this industry is bar none. And you're
15:05
going to see us in fact continue to do that if not accelerate. These models are also world class.
15:14
All systems are down. This never happens in Santa Clara.
15:22
Is it because of Las Vegas?
15:30
Somebody must have went won a jackpot outside. All systems are down.
15:40
Okay. I think my system's still down, but that's okay. I I I've I uh I'll make
15:45
it up as I go. And so so uh not only are these models uh frontier capable, not
15:52
only are they open, they're also top the leaderboards. This is an area where we're very proud. They top leaderboards
15:58
in intelligence. Uh we have uh uh important models that understand multimodality documents otherwise known
16:05
as PDFs. The most valuable content in the world are captured in PDFs. But
16:10
there it takes artificial intelligence to find out what's inside, interpret what's inside and help you read it. And
16:17
so our PDF retrievers, our PDF parsers are worldclass. Our speech recognition models absolutely
16:25
worldclass. Our retrieval models, basically search, semantic search, AI
16:30
search, the database engine of the modern AI era, world class. So we're on
16:36
top of leaderboards constantly. This is an area we're very proud of. And all of that is in service of your ability to
16:45
build AI agents. This is really a groundbreaking area of development. You
16:50
know, at first when PE when Chad GPT came out, people said, you know, uh gosh, it it produced really interesting
16:56
results, but it hallucinated greatly. And the reason why it hallucinated, of course, it could memorize everything um
17:03
in the past, but it can't memorize everything in the future, in the current. And so, it needs to be grounded
17:08
in research. It has to do fundamental research before it answers a question. The ability to reason about do I have to
17:15
do research? Do I have to use tools? How do I break up a problem into steps? Each one of these steps something that that
17:21
the AI model knows how to do and together it is able to compose it into a
17:27
sequence of steps to perform something it's never done before, never been trained to do. This is the wonderful
17:33
capability of reasoning. We could we could be we can encounter a circumstance we've never seen before and break it
17:40
down into circumstances and knowledge or rules that we know how to do because
17:46
we've experienced it in the past. And so the ability for AI models now to be able to reason incredibly powerful. The
17:53
reasoning capability of agents open the doors to all of these different applications. We no longer have to train
17:58
an AI model to know everything on day one just as we don't have to know
18:04
everything on day one. That we should be able to in every circumstance reason about how to solve that problem. Large
18:11
language models has now made this fundamental leap. The ability to use reinforcement learning and chain of
18:17
thought and you know search and planning and all these different techniques and reinforcement learning has made it
18:22
possible for us to have this basic capability and is also now completely
18:27
open sourced. But the thing that's really terrific is another breakthrough that happened and the first time I saw
18:33
it was with Arvin's perplexity. Perplexity, the search company, the AI
18:39
search company, really f really innovative company. And the first time I realized they were using multiple models
18:45
at the same time, I thought it was completely genius. Of course, we would do that. Of course, an AI would also
18:52
call upon all of the world's great AIs to solve the problem it wants to solve at any part of the reasoning chain. And
19:00
this is the reason why AIs are really multi-modal
19:06
meaning they understand speech and images and text and videos and 3D
19:13
graphics and proteins. It's multimodal. It's also multi-model
19:18
meaning that it should be able to use any model that best fits the task. It is
19:25
multicloud by definition. care for because these AI models are sitting in all these different places and it also
19:32
is hybrid cloud because if you're an enterprise company or you've built a robot or whatever that device is
19:39
sometimes it's at the edge sometimes a radio cell tower maybe sometimes it's in
19:44
an enterprise or maybe it's a place where a hospital where you need to have the the data in real time right next to
19:51
you whatever those applications are we know now this is what an AI application
19:57
looks like in the future. Or another way to think about that because future
20:02
applications are built on AIs. This is the basic framework of future
20:08
applications. This basic framework, this basic structure of agentic AIs that could do
20:15
the things that I'm talking about that is multi-model has now turbocharged
20:21
AI startups of all kinds. And now you can also because of the all of the open
20:27
models and all the tools that we provided you, you could also customize your AIS to teach your AI skills that
20:34
nobody else is teaching. Nobody else is causing their AI to become intelligent or smart in that way. You could do it
20:42
for yourself. And that's the work that we do with Neimotron Nemo and all of the things that we do with open models is
20:48
intended to do. You put a smart router in front of it and that router is essentially a manager that decides which
20:55
one of the task based on the intention of the prompts that you give it which one of the models is best fit for that
21:02
application for that solving that problem. Okay. So now when you think about this architecture, what do you
21:09
have? When you think about this architecture, all of a sudden you have an AI that's on the one hand completely
21:16
customizable by you. Something that you could teach to do your own very skills
21:21
for your company, something that's domain secret, something where you have deep domain expertise. Maybe you've got
21:28
all of the data that you need to train that AI model. On the other hand, your
21:33
AI is always at the frontier by definition. You're always at the
21:39
frontier on the one hand. You're always customized on the other hand and it should just run. And so we thought we
21:45
would make the simplest of examples to make it available to you. This entire framework we call a blueprint and we
21:53
have blueprints that are integrated into enterprise SAS platforms all over the world and we're really pleased with the
21:59
progress. But what we do is show you a a short example of something that anybody can do.
22:07
Let's build a personal assistant. I wanted to help me with my calendar, emails, to-do lists, and even keep an
22:13
eye on my home. I use Brev to turn my DGX Spark into a personal cloud. So, I
22:20
can use the same interface whether I'm using a cloud GPU or a DGX Spark. I use a Frontier model API to easily get
22:26
started. [Music] I want it to help me with my emails. So,
22:32
I create an email tool for my agent to call. I want my emails to stay private, so
22:38
I'll add an open model that's running locally on the Spark.
22:44
Now, for any job, I want the agent to use the right model for the right task. So, I'll use an intentbased model
22:50
router. This way, prompts that need email will stay on my Spark, and everything else
22:57
can call the Frontier model. I want my assistant to interact with my world, so I'll hook it up to Hugging Faces Reichi
23:04
Mini Robot. My agent controls the head, ears, and camera of the Reachi with tool calls. I
23:11
want to give Richi a voice, and I really like 11 Labs, so I'll hook up their API. Hi, I'm Richi running on DGX Spark.
23:18
Hey Richi, what's on my to-do list today? your to-do list today.
23:24
Grab groceries, eggs, milk, butter, and send Jensen the new script.
23:30
Okay, let's send Jensen that update. Tell him we'll have it for him by the end of the day. We'll do.
23:35
Reachi, there's a sketch, too. Can you turn it into an architectural rendering?
23:40
Sure. [Music]
23:49
Nice. Now make a video and show me around the room.
23:54
Here you go. That's great. With Brev, I can share access to my
24:00
Spark and Reachi, so I'm going to share it with Anna. Hey Richi, what's Potato up to?
24:08
He's on the couch. I remember you don't like this. I'll tell him to get off. Potato, off the
24:15
couch. With all the progress in open source, it's incredible to see what you can build. I'd love to see what you create.
24:23
[Music] Isn't that incredible?
24:29
Now, the amazing thing is that is utterly trivial now. That is utterly
24:35
trivial now. And yet, just a couple years ago, all of that would have been
24:40
impossible. Absolutely unimaginable. Well, this basic framework, this basic way of building applications using
24:48
language models
24:57
using language models. Using language models using language
25:04
models that are pre-trained and they're proprietary, they're frontier. combine
25:10
it with customized language models into a aentic framework, a reasoning
25:15
framework that allows you to access tools and files and maybe even connect
25:20
to other agents. This is basically the architecture of AI
25:27
applications or applications in the modern age and the ability for us to create these applications are incredibly
25:33
fast. And notice if you give it this application um
25:39
information that it's never seen before or in a structure that has is not
25:44
represented exactly as you thought it can still reason through it and make its best
25:51
effort to reason through the data the information to try to understand how to solve the problem artificial
25:57
intelligence. Okay. So this basic framework is now being integrated and and everything that I just described. We
26:03
have the benefit of working with some of the world's leading enterprise platform companies. Uh Palunteer for example
26:10
um their their entire AI and data processing platform is being integrated
26:15
accelerated by Nvidia today. Service Now the world's leading customer service and
26:21
um employee service platform. Snowflake the world's top data platform in the
26:26
cloud. uh incredible work that that uh is being done there. Uh code rabbit or
26:32
we're using code rabbit all over Nvidia. Uh Crowdstrike creating AIs to detect to
26:37
find AI threats. Uh NetApp their AI their data platform now has NVIDIA
26:43
semantic AI on top of it and agentic systems on top of it uh uh to for uh for
26:49
them to do customer service. But the important thing is this. Not only is this the way that you develop
26:54
applications now, this is going to be the user interface of your platform. So
27:00
whether it's Palanteer or Service Now or Snowflake and many other companies that
27:05
we're working with, the agentic system is the interface. It's no longer Excel
27:11
with a bunch of, you know, squares that you enter enter information into. Maybe it's no longer could just command line.
27:18
the any all of that multimodality information is now possible and the way
27:23
you interact with your platform is much more well if you will simple like you're
27:29
interacting with people and so that's enterprise AI being revolutionized by
27:35
angentic systems the next thing is physical AI this is an area that you've seen me talk about for several years in
27:41
fact we've been working on this for eight years the question is how do you take something that is intelligent
27:48
inside a computer and interacts with you with screens and speakers to something
27:56
that can interact with the world. Meaning it can understand the common sense of how the world works. Object
28:03
permanence. If I look away and I look back, that object is still there. Um causality. If I push it, it tips over.
28:10
It understands friction and gravity. It understands inertia. that a heavy truck
28:16
rolling down the road is going to need a little bit more time to stop, that a
28:21
ball is going to keep on rolling. These ideas are common sense to even a
28:26
little child, but for AI, it's completely unknown. And so we have to
28:32
create a system that allows AIs to learn the the common sense of the physical world, learn its laws, but also to be
28:42
able to of course learn from data and the data is quite scarce and to be able to evaluate whether that AI is working,
28:50
meaning it has to simulate in an environment. How does an AI know that
28:55
the the actions that it's performing is consistent with what it should do if it doesn't have the ability to simulate the
29:02
response of the physical world back on its actions. The response of its actions is really important to simulate
29:08
otherwise there's no way to evaluate it. It's different every time. And so this basic system requires three computers.
29:16
One computer, of course, the one that we know that Nvidia builds for training the AI models. Another computer that we know
29:24
is to inference the computer. Inference the models. Inferencing the model is essentially a robotics computer that
29:31
runs in a car or runs in a robot or runs in a factory runs anywhere at the edge. But there has to be another computer
29:37
that's designed for simulation. And simulation is at the heart of almost everything Nvidia does. This is this is
29:44
where we are most comfortable. and simulation was really the foundations of
29:50
almost everything that we've done with physical AI. So we have three computers and multiple stacks that run on these
29:57
computers, these libraries to make them useful. Omniverse is our digital twin physically based simulation world.
30:04
Cosmos, as I mentioned earlier, is our foundation model, not a foundation model for language, but a foundation model of
30:11
the world and is also aligned with language. You could say something like,
30:17
you know, what's happening to the ball and they'll they'll tell you the ball's rolling down the street. And so a world
30:22
foundation model and then of course the robotics models. We have two of them. One of them is called Groot. The other
30:29
one's called Alpamo that I'm going to tell you about. Now the one of the most important things that we have to do with physical AI is to create the data to
30:37
train the AI in the first place. Where does that data come from? Rather than instead of having languages because we
30:43
created a bunch of text that are what we consider ground truth that the AI can
30:49
learn from, how do we teach an AI the ground truth of physics? There lots and lots of videos, lots and lots of videos,
30:56
but hardly enough to capture the diversity and the type of interactions that we need. And so this is where great
31:04
minds came together and transformed what used to be compute into data. Now
31:13
using synthetic data generation that is grounded and conditioned by the laws of
31:19
physics, grounded and conditioned by ground truth, we can now selectively
31:25
cleverly generate data that we can then use to train the AI. So for example,
31:31
what comes into this AI, this Cosmos AI world model on the left on over here is
31:38
the output of a traffic simulator. Now this traffic simulator
31:44
is hardly enough for an AI to learn from. We can take this, put it into a
31:50
Cosmos foundation model and generate surround video that is physically based
31:57
and physically plausible that the AI can now learn from. And there are so many
32:02
examples of this. Let me show you what Cosmos can do.
32:08
The chat GPT moment for physical AI is nearly here, but the challenge is clear.
32:15
The physical world is diverse and unpredictable. Collecting real world training data is
32:22
slow and costly and it's never enough. The answer is synthetic data. It starts
32:29
with NVIDIA Cosmos, an open Frontier World Foundation model for physical AI
32:37
pre-trained on internet scale video, real driving and robotics data, and 3D
32:43
simulation. Cosmos learned a unified representation of the world, able to align language,
32:50
images, 3D, and action. It performs physical AI skills like
32:57
generation, reasoning, and trajectory prediction from a single image. Cosmos generates
33:04
realistic video from 3D scene descriptions, physically
33:11
coherent motion, from driving telemetry and sensor logs,
33:17
surround video from planning simulators, multi- camera
33:23
environments, or from scenario prompts. It brings edge
33:29
cases to life. Developers can run interactive closed loop simulations in Cosmos. When actions
33:37
are made, the world responds. Cosmos reasons.
33:44
It analyzes edge scenarios, breaks them down into familiar physical interactions, and reasons about what
33:51
could happen next. Cosmos turns compute into data, training
33:57
AVs for the longtail and robots how to adapt for every scenario.
34:05
[Music]
34:11
I know it's incredible. Cosmos is the world's leading foundation
34:18
model. World foundation model. It's been downloaded millions of times, used all over the world, getting world getting
34:25
the world ready for this new era of physical AI. We use it ourselves as well. We use it ourselves to create our
34:33
self-driving car. using it for scenario generation and
34:38
using it for evaluation. We could have something that allows us to effectively travel billions,
34:46
trillions of miles, but doing it inside a computer. And we've made enormous
34:52
progress. Today, we're announcing Alpio, the world's first
34:58
thinking reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. Up myio
35:05
is trained end to end. Literally from camera in to actuation out. The camera
35:12
in lots and lots of miles that are driven by itself or human drive it driven using human
35:20
demonstration and we have lots and lots of miles that are generated by cosmos. In addition to
35:26
that, hundreds of thousands of examples are labeled very very carefully so that
35:33
we could teach the car how to drive. Alpha Mayo does something that's really special. Not only does it take sensor
35:39
input and activates steering wheel, brakes and and acceleration, it also
35:47
reasons about what action it is about to take. It tells you what action it's
35:53
going to take. the reasons by which it came about that action and then of course the trajectory.
36:00
All of these are coupled directly and trained very specifically by a large
36:05
combination of human trained and as well as Cosmos generated data. The result of
36:12
it is just really incredible. Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive and it drives so naturally
36:19
because it learned directly from human demonstrators but in every single scenario when it comes up to the
36:25
scenario it reasons about it tells you what it's going to do and it reasons about what you what's about to do. Now
36:31
the reason why this is so important is because of the long tale of driving there. It's impossible for us to simply
36:39
collect every single possible scenario for everything that could ever happen in every single country and every single
36:45
circumstance that's possibly ever going to happen for all of population.
36:50
However, it is very unlikely it's very likely that every scenario if decomposed
36:57
into a whole bunch of other smaller scenarios are quite normal for you to understand. And so these long tales will
37:05
be decomposed into quite normal circumstances that the car knows how to deal with. It just needs to reason about
37:11
it. And so let's take a look. Everything you're about to see is one shot. It's uh no hands
37:19
[Music] routing to your destination. Buckle up.
37:29

37:40

38:37

39:32
[Music] [Applause]
39:39
[Music]
39:49
[Music]
39:56
You have arrived.
40:12
We started working on self-driving cars eight years ago. And the reason for that is because we reasoned early on that
40:19
deep learning and artificial intelligence was going to reinvent the entire computing stack. And if we were
40:24
ever going to understand how to navigate ourselves and how to guide the industry
40:30
towards this new future, we have to get good at building the entire stack. Well,
40:36
as I mentioned earlier, AI is a five layer cake. The lowest layer is land
40:41
power and shell. In the case of robotics, the lowest layer is the car. The next layer above it is chips, GPUs,
40:48
networking chips, CPUs, all that kind of stuff. The next layer above that is the
40:54
infrastructure. That infrastructure in this particular case as I mentioned with physical AI is
41:00
omniverse and cosmos. And then above that are the models. And
41:06
in the case of the models above that I just shown you.
41:12
The model here is called Alpha Mayo. And Alpha Mayo today is open sourced. We
41:18
this incredible body of work. It took several thousand people. Our AV team is
41:24
several thousand people. Just to put in perspective, our partner uh Ola, I think
41:30
Ola's here in the audience somewhere. Uh Mercedes agreed to partner with us five
41:35
years ago to go make all of this possible. We imagine that someday a
41:41
billion cars on a road will all be autonomous. You could either have it be a robo taxi that you're you're
41:47
you'rechestrating and and renting from somebody or you could own it and is driving for driving
41:52
by itself or you could decide to drive for yourself. And so but every single car will have autonomous vehicle
41:58
capability. Every single car will be AI powered. And so the the the model layer in this case is Alpha Mayo and the
42:05
application above that is the Mercedes-Benz. Okay. And so, so this entire stack is
42:12
our first Nvidia first entire stack endeavor and we've been working on it for this entire time. And I'm just so
42:18
happy that the first AV car from Nvidia is going to be on the road in Q1 and
42:25
then it goes Europe in Q2 here in United States in Q1 then Europe in Q2 and I think it's Asia in Q3 and Q4. And the
42:33
powerful thing is that we're going to keep on updating it with next ver next versions of Alpameo and versions after
42:39
that. There's no question in my mind now that this is going to be one of the largest robotics industries. And I'm so
42:46
happy that we worked on it. And it taught us enormous amount about how to help the rest of the world build robotic
42:52
systems. that deep understanding and knowing how to build it ourselves, building the entire infrastructure
42:58
ourselves and knowing what kind of chips a robotic system would would need. In this partic particular case, dual Orins,
43:06
the next generation dual Thors. These processors are designed for robotic
43:11
systems and was designed for the sa highest level of safety capability. This
43:17
car just got rated. It just went to production. The Mercedes-Benz CLA was
43:25
just rated by NCAAP, the world's safest car.
43:34
It is the only system that I know that has every single line of code, the chip,
43:40
the system, every line of code safety certified. The entire model system is
43:46
based on a sensors are diverse and redundant and so is the self-driving car
43:51
stack. The Alpha Mayo stack is trained end to end and has incredible skills.
43:57
However, nobody knows until you drive it forever that it's going to be perfectly
44:02
safe. And so that we the way we guard rail that is with another software stack, an entire AV stack underneath.
44:10
That entire AV stack is built to be fully traceable and it's taken us some five years to build that some six seven
44:17
years actually to build that second stack. These two software stacks are mirroring each other and then we have a
44:24
policy and safety evaluator decide is this something that I'm very confident and can reason about driving very
44:31
safely. If so, I'm going to have Alpamo do it. If it's a circumstance that I'm not very confident in and the safety um
44:37
policy evaluator decide that we're going to go back to a a very a simpler safer
44:43
guardrail system, then it goes back to the classical AV stack where the only car in the world with both of these AV
44:48
stacks running and all safety systems should have diversity and redundancy. Well, our vision is that someday every
44:55
single car, every single truck will be autonomous and we've been working towards that future. This entire stack
45:01
is vertically integrated. Of course, in the case of Mercedes-Benz, we built the entire stack together. We're going to
45:06
deploy the car. We're going to operate the stack. We're going to maintain the stack for as long as we shall live. However, like everything else we do as a
45:14
company. We build the entire stack, but the entire stack is open for the
45:19
ecosystem. And these the ecosystem working with us to build L4 and robo
45:24
taxis is expanding and it's going everywhere. I fully expect this to be well this is
45:31
already a giant business for us. It's a giant business for us because they use it for training our training data
45:36
processing data and training their models. They use it for synthetic data generation in some cases and some car
45:42
and some companies they pretty much just build uh the computers the chips that are inside the car and some companies
45:49
work with us full stack some companies work with us some partial part of that. Okay. So it doesn't matter uh how much
45:56
you decide to use. You know, my only request is that use a little bit of video wherever you can and uh you know,
46:02
but uh the entire thing is open. Now, this is going to be the first large
46:09
scale mainstream um AI physical AI market and this is now
46:15
I think we can all agree fully here and this inflection point of going from not
46:21
autonomous vehicles to autonomous vehicles is probably happening right about this time. in in the next 10
46:28
years, I'm fairly certain a very very large percentage of the world's cars will be autonomous or highly autonomous.
46:35
But this is this basic technique that I just described in using the three computers using synthetic data
46:41
generation and simulation applies to every form of robotic systems. It could
46:46
be a robot that is just an articulator, a manipulator, maybe it's a mobile robot, maybe it's a fully humanoid
46:53
robot. And so the next journey, the next era for robotic systems is
47:00
going to be, you know, robots. And these robots are going to come in all kinds of different sizes. And and uh I invited
47:06
some friends. Did they come?
47:14
Hey guys, hurry up. I got a lot of stuff to cover.
47:20
Come on, hurry. Did you tell R2-D2 you're going to be
47:27
here? Did you? And C3PO.
47:34
Okay. All right. Come here. Before now, one of the things that one of the things that's really You have Jetsons. They
47:40
have little Jetson computers inside them. They're trained inside Omniverse.
47:46
And how about this? Let's show everybody the simulator that you were that you guys learned how to how to be robots in.
47:53
You you guys want to look at that? Okay, let's look at that. Run it, please.
48:00
[Music]
48:08
[Music]
48:32
What are you doing? [Music]
48:58
Isn't that amazing? That's how you learn to be a robot. You
49:05
did it all inside Omniverse. And the robot simulator is called Isaac. Isaac
49:11
Sim and Isaac Lab. And anybody who wants to build a robot, you know, nobody could nobody's gonna be as cute as you. But
49:19
now we have all Look at all these look at all these friends that we have building robots. We have We're building
49:24
big ones. No, like I said, nobody's as cute as you guys are. But we have Neurobot and we have we have Aubot.
49:31
Aubot over there, you know. We have uh uh LG over here. They just announced a
49:36
new robot. Caterpillar. They've got the largest robots ever. That one delivers food to
49:42
your house. That's connected to Uber Eats. And that's Surf Robot. I love those guys. Agility. Boston Dynamics.
49:51
Incredible. You got surgical robots. You got manipulated robots from Franka.
49:57
You got universal robotics robot. Incredible number of different robots. And so this is the next chapter. We're
50:04
going to talk a lot more about robotics in the future, but it's not just about the robots in the end. I know
50:10
everything's about you guys. It's about getting there. And one of the air, one of the most important industries in the
50:15
world that will be revolutionized by physical AI and AI physics
50:21
is the industry that started all of us at NVIDIA. It wouldn't be possible if
50:27
not for the companies that I'm about to talk to. And I'm so happy that all of them starting with Cadence is going to
50:34
accelerate everything. Cadence CUDA X integrated into all of their simulations and solvers. They've got uh NVIDIA
50:41
physical physical AIs that they're going to use for uh for different um uh physical plants and plant simulations.
50:47
You got AI physics being integrated into these systems. So whether it's an EDA or
50:53
SDA um and in the future robotic systems, we're going to have basically
50:58
the same technology that made you guys possible now completely revolutionize
51:03
these design stacks. Synopsis without Synopsis, you know, Synopsis and Cadence are completely completely indispensable
51:12
in the world of chip design. uh synopsis is uh leads in uh in uh logic design and
51:18
and IP. Uh in the case of cadence, they lead physical design, the place and
51:24
route uh and emulation and verification. Cadence is incredible at emulation and verification. Both of them are moving
51:31
into the world of system design and system simulation. And so in the future,
51:37
we're going to design your chips inside Cadence and inside Synopsis. We're going to design your systems and emulate the
51:44
whole thing and simulate everything inside these tools. That's your future. We're going to give Yeah. You're going
51:50
to be born inside these inside these platforms. Pretty amazing, right? And so
51:55
we're so happy that we're working with these these industries just as we've integrated NVIDIA into Palunteer and
52:01
Service Now. We're integrating Nvidia into the most computationally intensive
52:07
simulation industries, Synopsis and Cadence. And today we're announcing that
52:12
Seammens is also doing the same thing. We're going to integrate CUDA X, physical AI, Agentic AI, Nemo, Neotron
52:20
deeply integrated into the world of Seammens. And the reason for that is this. First, we designed the chips and
52:29
all of it in the future will be accelerated by Nvidia. You're going to be very happy about that. We're going to have agent chip designers and system
52:37
designers working with us, helping us do design just as we have agentic software
52:42
engineers helping our software engineers code today. And so we'll have agentic chip designers and system designers.
52:49
We're going to create you inside this. But then we have to build you. We have
52:54
to build the plants, the factories that make manufacture you. We have to design
53:01
the manufacturing lines that assemble all of you. And these manufacturing plants are going to be essentially
53:08
gigantic robots. Incredible, isn't that right? I know. I know. And so, you're going to
53:16
be designed in a computer. You're going to be made in a computer. You're going to be tested and evaluated in a computer
53:23
long before long before you have to spend any time dealing gravity.
53:29
I know. Do you know how to deal with gravity? Can you jump?
53:36
Can you jump?
53:48
Okay. All right. Don't show off. Okay. So, so this so now
53:54
the industry the industry that made Nvidia possible. We're I'm just so happy
53:59
that that now the technology that we're creating is at a level of sophistication and capability that we can now help them
54:06
revolutionize their industry. And so what started with with uh with them, we
54:11
now have the opportunity to go back and and help them revolutionize theirs. Let's take a look at the stuff that we're going to do with Seammens.
54:18
Come on. Breakthroughs in physical AI are letting AI move from screens to our physical
54:27
world. And just in time, as the world builds factories of every kind for chips,
54:34
computers, life-saving drugs, and AI, as the global labor shortage worsens, we
54:40
need automation powered by physical AI and robotics more than ever.
54:48
This where AI meets the world's largest physical industries is the foundation of NVIDIA and Seammen's partnership. For
54:55
nearly two centuries, Seammens has built the world's industries and now it is reinventing it for the age
55:03
of AI. Semens is integrating NVIDIA CUDA X
55:08
libraries, AI models, and Omniverse into its portfolio of EDA,
55:17
CAE, and digital twin tools and platforms.
55:23
Together, we're bringing physical AI to the full industrial life cycle.
55:29
From design and simulation to production
55:35
[Music] and operations, we stand at the beginning of a new
55:40
industrial revolution, the age of physical AI built by Nvidia and Seammens
55:46
for the next age of industries.
55:52
Incredible, right guys? What do you think? All right, I'll hang
55:58
on tight. Just hang on tight. And so, so this is, you know, if you look at look at the world's models, there's no
56:06
question OpenAI is the the the leading token generator today. More to more open
56:12
AAI tokens are generated than just about anything else. The second largest group, the second largest probably open models.
56:19
And my guess is that over time because there are so many companies, so many researchers, so many different types of
56:24
domains and modalities that open- source models will be by far the largest. Let's
56:30
talk about somebody really special. You guys want to do that? Let's talk about Vera Rubin. Vera Rubin. Yeah, go ahead.
56:38
She's a American astronomer. She was the first to observe. She
56:43
noticed that the tails of the galaxies were moving about as fast
56:50
as the center of the galaxies. Well, I know it makes no sense. It makes no
56:55
sense. Newtonian physics would say just like the solar system, the planets further away from the sun is circulating
57:03
circ cir circling the sun slower than the planets closer to the sun. And
57:09
therefore, it makes no sense that this happens unless there's
57:14
invisible bodies, we call them, she discovered, dark body, dark matter, um
57:19
that occupy space even though we don't see it. And so Vera Rubin is the person that
57:25
we named our next computer after. Isn't that a good idea?
57:32
I know. [Applause] Okay. Vera Rubin is designed to address
57:38
this fundamental challenge that we have. The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing. The demand for
57:45
NVIDIA GPUs is skyrocketing. It's skyrocketing because models are increasing by a factor of 10, an order
57:52
of a magnitude every single year. And not to mention, as I mentioned, 01's
57:58
introduction was an inflection point for AI. Instead of a oneshot answer,
58:04
inference is now a thinking process. And in order to teach the AI how to think,
58:10
reinforcement learning and very significant computation was introduced
58:16
into post-training. It wasn't no long it's no longer supervised fine-tuning or
58:21
otherwise known as imitation learning or supervision training. You now have
58:26
reinforcement learning. Essentially the computer trial trying different iterations itself learning how to
58:33
perform a task. The amount of computation for pre pre-training for post-training for test time scaling has
58:40
exploded as a result of that. And now every single inference that we do
58:45
instead of just one shot the number of tokens you could just see the AI think which we appreciate. The longer it
58:51
thinks oftentimes it produces a better answer. And so test time scaling causes the number of tokens to be generated to
58:57
increase by 5x every single year. Not to mention, meanwhile, the race is on for
59:05
AI. Everybody's trying to get to the next level, everybody's trying to get to the next frontier. And every time they
59:10
get to the next frontier, the last generation AI tokens, the cost starts to
59:16
starts to decline about a factor of 10x every year. The 10x decline every year
59:21
is actually telling you something different. It's saying that the race is so intense. Everybody's trying to get to
59:28
the next level and somebody is getting to the next level. And so therefore, all of it is a computing problem. The faster
59:35
you compute, the sooner you can get to the next level of the next frontier. All of these things are simultaneously
59:40
happening at the same time. And so we decided that we have to advance
59:47
the state-of-the-art of computation every single year. Not one year left
59:52
behind. And now we've been shipping GB200s
59:57
year and a half ago. Right now we're in fullscale manufacturing of GB300.
1:00:03
And if Vera Rubin is going to be in time for this year, it must be in production
1:00:09
by now. And so today I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.
1:00:20
You guys want to take a look at Vera Rubin? All right. Come on. Play it, please.
1:00:28
Vera Rubin arrives just in time for the next frontier of AI.
1:00:34
This is the story of how we built it. The architecture, a system of six chips
1:00:40
engineered to work as one, born from extreme code design. It begins with Vera, a custom-designed CPU, double the
1:00:47
performance of the previous generation. And the Reuben GPU, Vera and Reuben are
1:00:53
co-designed from the start to birectionally and coherently share data faster and with lower latency.
1:01:00
Then 17,000 components come together on a Ver Rubin compute board.
1:01:08
High-speed robots place components with micron precision before the Vera CPU and
1:01:14
two Reuben GPUs complete the assembly capable of delivering 100 pedlops of AI,
1:01:22
five times that of its predecessor. AI needs data fast.
1:01:29
Connect X9 delivers 1.6 6 terabs per second of scale out bandwidth to each
1:01:35
GPU. Bluefield 4 DPU offloads storage and
1:01:41
security so compute stays fully focused on AI. The Vera Rubin compute tray completely
1:01:48
redesigned with no cables, hoses, or fans. Featuring a Bluefield 4 DPU, eight
1:01:56
Connect X9 Nix, two Vera CPUs, and four Reuben GPUs, the compute building block
1:02:03
of the Vera Rubin AI supercomputer. Next, the sixth generation MVLink
1:02:10
switch, moving more data than the global internet, connecting 18 compute nodes,
1:02:16
scaling up to 72 Reuben GPUs, operating as one.
1:02:23
Then Spectrum X Ethernet Photonix,
1:02:28
the world's first Ethernet switch with 512 lanes and 200 Gbit capable
1:02:34
co-packaged optics scale out thousands of racks into an AI factory.
1:02:41
15,000 engineer years since design began, the first Vera Rubin MVL 72 rack
1:02:48
comes online. Six breakthrough chips, 18 compute trays, nine MVLink switch trays,
1:02:55
220 trillion transistors weighing nearly two tons.
1:03:02
One giant leap to the next frontier of AI. Reuben is here.
1:03:14
What do you guys think? This is a Reuben pod. 1152 GPUs
1:03:25
in 16 racks. Each one of the racks as you know has uh 72
1:03:34
Vera Rubin or 72 Reubins. Each one of the Reubins is two actual GPU dies
1:03:41
connected together. And I'm going to show I'm going to show it to you, but there are several things that Well, I'll
1:03:48
tell you later. I can't tell you everything right away.
1:03:55
Well, we designed six different chips. First of all, we have a rule inside our company, and it's a good rule. No new
1:04:01
generation should have more than one or two chips change. But the problem is
1:04:07
this. As you could see, we were describing the total number of transistors in each one of the chips
1:04:12
that were being described. And we know that Moore's law has largely slowed. And so, the number of transistors we can get
1:04:19
year after year after year can't possibly keep up with the 10 times
1:04:25
larger models. It can't possibly keep up with five times per year more tokens
1:04:31
generated. It can't possibly keep up with the fact that cost decline of the
1:04:36
tokens are going to be so aggressive. It is impossible to keep up with those kind of rates if the indust for the industry
1:04:44
to continue to advance unless we deployed aggressive extreme code design
1:04:50
basically innovating across all of the chips across the entire stack all at the
1:04:55
same time. which is the reason why we decided that this generation we had no choice but to design every chip over
1:05:02
again. Now every single chip that we were describing just now can be a press conference in all in itself and there's
1:05:09
an entire company who's probably dedicated to doing that back in the old days. Each one of them are completely
1:05:14
revolutionary and the best of its kind. The Vera CPU I'm so proud of it in a
1:05:21
power constrained world. Gray CPU is two times the performance in a power
1:05:28
constrained world. It's twice the performance per watt of the world's most advanced CPUs. Its data rate is insane.
1:05:35
It was designed to process supercomputers and Vera was an
1:05:41
incredible GPU. Grace was an incredible GPU. Now Vera increases the
1:05:47
singlethreaded performance, increases the capacity of the memory, increases everything just dramatically. It's a
1:05:53
giant chip. This is the Vera CPU. This is one CPU.
1:05:59
And this is connected to the Reuben GPU. Look at that thing.
1:06:08
It's a giant chip. Now, the thing that's really special, and I I'll go through these. It's going to take three hands, I
1:06:15
think, four hands to do this. Okay. So, this is the Verus Ver CPU. It's got 88
1:06:20
CPU cores. And the CPU cores are designed to be multi-threaded. But the multi-threaded nature of of uh Vera was
1:06:28
designed so that each one of the 176 threads could get its full full
1:06:33
performance. So it's essentially as of there's 176 cores but only 88 physical cores. So these cores were designed in
1:06:40
in using a technology called spatial multi-threading. But the IO performance is incredible. This is the Reuben GPU.
1:06:47
It's 5x Blackwell in floating performance. But the important thing is go to the bottom line. The bottom line,
1:06:53
it's only 1.6 times the number of transistors of Blackwell. That kind of tells you something about the the levels
1:07:00
of semiconductor physics today. If we don't do code design, if we do don't do
1:07:05
extreme code design at the level of basically every single chip across the entire system, how is it
1:07:13
possible we deliver performance levels that is, you know, at best one point 1
1:07:18
1.6 times each year? Because that's the total number of transistors you have. And even if you were to have a little
1:07:24
bit more um performance per transistor, say 25%, you're this impossible to get a
1:07:29
100% yield out of the number of transistors you get. And so 1.6x kind of puts a ceiling on how far performance
1:07:36
can go each year unless you do something extreme. And we call it extreme code design. Well, one of the things that one
1:07:42
of the things that we did and it was a great invention. It's called MVF FP4 tensor core. The transformer engine
1:07:49
inside our chip is not just a 4bit floatingoint number somehow that we put into the data path. It is an entire
1:07:56
processor, a processing unit that understands how to dynamically
1:08:02
adaptively adjust its precision and structure to deal with different levels
1:08:08
of the transformer so that you can achieve higher throughput wherever it's possible to lose precision and to go
1:08:15
back to the highest possible precision wherever you need to. that ability to dynamically do that. You can't do this
1:08:22
in software because obviously it's just running too fast. And so you have to be able to do it adaptively inside the
1:08:29
processor. That's what an MV FP4 is. When somebody says FP4 or FP8, it almost
1:08:35
means nothing to us. And the reason for that is because it's the tensor core structure in all of the algorithms that
1:08:41
makes makes it work. MVF FP4, we've published papers on this already. The precision that the the level of
1:08:47
throughput and precision it's able to retain is in and completely incredible. This is groundbreaking work. I would not
1:08:53
be surprised that the industry would like us to make this format and this structure an industry standard in the
1:08:59
future. This is completely revolutionary. This is how we were able to deliver such a gigantic step up in
1:09:05
performance even though we only have 1.6 times the number of transistors. Okay.
1:09:11
So this is and now once you have a great processing node and this is the processor node and inside so this is
1:09:19
this is for example here let me do this
1:09:26
this is this is wow it's super heavy you have to be a CEO in really good shape to
1:09:33
do this job okay all right so this thing is I'm
1:09:41
gonna guess this is probably I don't know couple of hundred pounds.
1:09:48
[Laughter] I thought that was funny.
1:09:54
Come on. It could have been. Everybody's going. I don't think so.
1:10:00
All right. So So look at this. This is the last one. We revolutionized the
1:10:05
entire MGX chassis. This node 43 cables,
1:10:13
zero cables, six tubes,
1:10:18
z just two of them here. It takes 2 hours to assemble this. If you're lucky,
1:10:26
it takes two hours. And of course, you're probably going to assemble it wrong. You're going to have to retest it, test it, reassemble it. So, the
1:10:33
assembly process is incredibly complicated. And it was understandable as one of our first supercomputers
1:10:39
that's deconstructed in this way. This from two hours to five minutes.
1:10:50
80% liquid cooled. 100% liquid cooled.
1:10:56
Yeah. Really, really a breakthrough. Okay. So, so this is the new compute
1:11:02
chassis and what connects all of these to the top of rack switches. The east
1:11:08
west traffic is called the spectrox Nick. This is the world's best nick.
1:11:14
Unquestionably Nvidia's Melanox, the acquisition Melanox that joined us a long time ago now. Um, this their
1:11:20
networking technology for high performance computing is the world's best bar none. the algorithms, the chip
1:11:26
design, all of the interconnects, all the software stacks that run on top of it, their RDMA, absolutely absolutely
1:11:33
bar none, the world's best. And now it has the ability to do programmable RDMA and data path accelerator so that our
1:11:39
partners like AI labs could create their own algorithms for how they want to move data around the system. But this is
1:11:46
completely world worldclass connect X9 and the Vera CPU were co-designed and
1:11:52
we never revealed it. not never never released it until CX9 came along because
1:11:58
we we co-designed it for a new type of processor. You know, Connect X9 or CX8 and Spectrum
1:12:06
X revolutionized how Ethernet was done for artificial intelligence. Ethernet
1:12:12
traffic for AI is much much more intense, requires much lower latency.
1:12:17
The the instantaneous surge of traffic is unlike anything Ethernet sees. And so
1:12:22
we created Spectrum X which is AI Ethernet. Two years ago we announced Spectrum X.
1:12:30
NVIDIA today is the largest networking company the world has ever seen. So it's
1:12:35
been so successful and used in so many different installations. It is just sweeping uh the AI landscape. The
1:12:42
performance is incredible especially when you have a 200 um megawatt data center or if you have a
1:12:50
gigawatt data center. These are billions of dollars. Let's say a gigawatt data center is $50 billion dollars. If the
1:12:57
networking performance allows you to deliver an extra 10%
1:13:03
in the case of Spectrum X delivering 25% higher throughput is not uncommon. If we
1:13:09
were to just deliver 10% that's worth $5 billion. The networking is completely
1:13:14
free which is the reason why well everybody uses Spectrum X. It's just an
1:13:20
incredible thing. And now we're going to invent a new type a new type of uh uh
1:13:25
data processing. And so Spectrox is for east west traffic. We now have a new
1:13:31
processor called Bluefield 4. Bluefield 4 allows us to take a large large very large data center isolate different
1:13:38
parts of it so that different users could use different parts of it. Make sure that everything could be virtualized if they decide to be
1:13:44
virtualized. So you offload a lot of the um virtualization software, the security
1:13:49
software, the networking software for your north south traffic. And so Bluefield 4 comes standard with every
1:13:56
single one of these compute nodes. Bluefield 4 has a second application I'm going to talk about in just a second.
1:14:02
This is a revolutionary processor and I'm so excited about it. This is the MVLink 6 switch
1:14:09
and it's right here. This is the this
1:14:14
switch. This switch chip there are four of them inside the MVLink switch here.
1:14:20
Each one of these switchips has the fastest certis in history. The world is
1:14:25
barely getting to 200 Gbits. This is 400 Gbits per second switch. The reason why
1:14:32
this is so important is so that we could have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at exactly the same time. This
1:14:39
switch, this switch on the back plane of one of these racks enables us to move
1:14:47
the equivalent of twice the amount of the global internet data,
1:14:54
twice as all of the world's internet data at twice the speed. You take the
1:14:59
cross-sectional bandwidth of the entire planet's internet, it's about 100 terabytes per second. This is 240
1:15:06
terabytes per second. So it kind of puts it in perspective. This is so that every single GPU can work with every single
1:15:12
other GPU at exactly the same time. Okay. Then on top of that
1:15:19
on top of that okay so this is one rack. This is one rack. Each one of the racks as you could see the number of
1:15:25
transistors in this one rack is 1.7 times.
1:15:34
Yeah. Could you do this for me? So, this is it's usually about two tons, but
1:15:40
today it's two and a half tons because um when they shipped it, they forgot to drain the water out of it.
1:15:48
So, we we shipped a lot of water from California.
1:15:55
Can you hear it squealing? You know, when you're rotating two and a half tons,
1:16:01
you're going to squeal a little. Oh, you could do it. Wow.
1:16:09
Okay, we just we won't make you do that twice. All right. So, so um so behind
1:16:15
behind this are the MVLink spines. Basically, two miles of copper cables.
1:16:22
Copper is the best conductor we know. And these are all shielded copper cables, structured copper cables, the
1:16:28
most the world's ever used in computing systems ever. and and um uh our certis
1:16:35
drive the copper cables from the top of the rack all the way to the bottom of the rack at 400 gigabits per second.
1:16:41
It's incredible. And so uh this has 2 miles of total copper cables, 5,000 copper cables, and this makes the MVLink
1:16:50
uh spine possible. This is the revolution that that really started the NGX system. Now we we decided that we
1:16:59
would create an industry standard system so that the entire ecosystem all of our supply chain could standardize on these
1:17:06
components. There some 80,000 different components that make up this
1:17:13
these MGX systems and it's a total waste if we're to change it every single year. every single major computer company from
1:17:20
Foxcon to Quanta to Wistron, you know, the list goes on and on and on to HP and
1:17:25
Dell and Lenovo, everybody knows how to build these systems. And so the fact that we could squeeze Ruben, Vera Rubin
1:17:34
into this even though the performance is so much so much higher and very
1:17:39
importantly the power is twice as high. The power of Vera Rubin is twice as high
1:17:44
as Grace Blackwell. And yet, and this is the miracle,
1:17:50
the air that goes into it, the the air flow is about the same. And very
1:17:55
importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45° C. With 45°
1:18:01
C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. We're basically cooling
1:18:08
this supercomput with hot water. is so incredibly efficient. And so
1:18:15
this is um this is the new the new rack. 1.7 times more transistors but five
1:18:21
times more peak inference performance. Three and a half times more peak um uh
1:18:28
uh training performance. Okay. They're connected on top using Spectrum
1:18:34
X. Oh, thank you. [Applause]
1:18:42
This is this is the world's first manufacturing chip using uh TSMC's
1:18:49
new process that we co-inovated called coupe. It's a silicon photonix integrated silicon photonix process
1:18:55
technology. And this allows us to take silicon photonix directly right to the
1:19:00
chip. And this is 512 ports at 200 gigabits per second. And this is the new
1:19:08
Ethernet AI switch, the Spectrum X Ethernet switch. And look at this giant chip. But what's really amazing, it's
1:19:15
got silicon photonics directly connected to it. And lasers come in.
1:19:23
Lasers come in through here. Lasers come in through here. The optics are here and
1:19:28
they connect out to the rest of the data data center. This I'll show you in a second, but this is on top of the rack.
1:19:35
And this is the new Spectrumax um silicon photonix switch. Okay.
1:19:44
And we have something new I want to tell you about. So just as I mentioned a couple years ago,
1:19:51
we introduced Spectrum X so that we could reinvent the way that networking is done. Um Ethernet is really easy to
1:19:58
manage and everybody has an Ethernet stack and every data center in the world knows how to deal with Ethernet. Um and
1:20:04
the only thing that we were we were using at the time was called Infiniband which is used for supercomputers.
1:20:10
Infiniband is very low latency. Um but of course the software stack the entire
1:20:15
manageability of Infiniband is very alien to the people who use Ethernet. So we decided to enter the Ethernet switch
1:20:21
market for the very first time. Spectrum X that just took off and it made us the
1:20:27
largest networking company in the world. As I mentioned, this next generation Spectrum X is going to carry on that
1:20:33
tradition. But just as I said earlier, AI has reinvented the whole computing
1:20:38
stack, every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason that when AI
1:20:43
starts to get deployed in the world's enterprises, it's going to also reinvent the way storage is done. Well, AI
1:20:49
doesn't use SQL. AI use semantics information. And when AI is being used,
1:20:55
it creates this temporary knowledge, temporary temporary memory calls KV cache, K key value combinations, but
1:21:04
it's a KV cache. Basically, the cache of the AI, the working memory of the AI. And the working memory of the AI is
1:21:10
stored in the HBM memory. every single token. For every single token,
1:21:17
the H the GPU reads in the model, the entire model, it reads in the entire
1:21:24
working memory and it produces one token and it stores that one token back into
1:21:30
the KV cache. And then the next to the next time it does that, it reads in the entire memory, reads it and it streams
1:21:38
it through our GPU and then generates another token. Well, it does this repeatedly, token after token after
1:21:44
token. And obviously, if you have a long conversation with that AI over time, that memory, that context memory is
1:21:50
going to grow tremendously. Not to mention, the models are growing. The number of turns that we're using, the AIS are are increasing. We would like to
1:21:57
have this AI stay with us our entire life. And remember, every single conversation we've ever had with it,
1:22:03
right? Every single lick of research that I've asked it for. Of course, with the number of people that will be
1:22:08
sharing the supercomputer is going to continue to grow. And so this context memory which started out fitting inside
1:22:14
an HBM is no longer large enough. Last year we created Grace Blackwell's
1:22:22
very fast memory we called fast context memory in that's the reason why we
1:22:27
connected Grace directly to Hopper. That's why we connected Grace directly to Blackwell so that we can expand the
1:22:34
context memory. But even that is not enough. And so the next solution of course is to go off onto the network the
1:22:41
north south network off to the storage of the company. But if you have a whole
1:22:47
lot of AI running at the same time that network is no longer going to be fast enough. So the answer is very clearly to
1:22:55
do it different. And so we intro we created Bluefield 4 so that we could essentially have a very fast KV cache
1:23:03
context memory store right in the rack. And so I'll show you in just one second.
1:23:10
But there's a whole new category of storage systems and the industry is so excited because this is a pain point for
1:23:17
just about everybody who does a lot of token generation today. the AI labs, the cloud service providers, they're really
1:23:24
suffering from the amount of network traffic that's causing being caused by KV cache moving around. And so the idea
1:23:31
that we would create a new platform, a new processor to run the entire Dynamo
1:23:38
KV cache context memory management system and to put it very close to the
1:23:43
rest of the rack is completely revolutionary. So this is it. This is it
1:23:48
sits right here. So this this is all the compute nodes.
1:23:54
Each one of these is MVLink 72. So this is Vera Rubin MVLink 72
1:24:01
144 U Reuben GPUs. This is the context memory that's stored here. Behind each
1:24:08
one of these are four blue fields. Behind each blue field is 150 gigab 150
1:24:14
terabytes 150 terabytes of memory context memory. And for each GPU once you allocate it
1:24:22
across each GPU will get an additional 16 terabytes. Now inside this node each
1:24:30
GPU essentially has one terabyte. And now with this backing store here
1:24:37
directly on the same east west traffic at exactly the same data rate 200 gigabits per second across literally the
1:24:45
entire fabric of this compute node. you're going to get an additional 16 terabytes of memory. Okay. And this is
1:24:53
the management plane. These are these are the spectrum X
1:25:01
switches that connects all of them together. And over here, these switches at the end
1:25:10
connects them to the rest of the data center. Okay? And so this is the Vera
1:25:15
Rubin. Now there's several things that's really incredible about it. So the first thing that I mentioned is that the this
1:25:23
entire system is twice the energy efficiency essentially the the twice
1:25:30
that the the temperature performance in the sense that that even though the power is twice as high the amount of
1:25:37
energy used is twice as high the amount of computation is many times higher than that but the liquid that goes into it
1:25:44
still 45 degrees C that enables us to save about 6% % of the world's data
1:25:49
center power. So that's a very big deal. The second very big deal
1:25:55
is that this entire system is now confidential computing safe. Meaning everything is encoded in transit at rest
1:26:02
and during compute and every single bus is now encrypted. every PCI Express,
1:26:09
every MV link, every H you know for MV link between CPU me and GPU between GPU
1:26:15
to GPU, everything is now encrypted and so it's confidential computing safe.
1:26:22
This allows companies to feel safe that their models are being deployed by
1:26:27
somebody else, but it will never be seen by anybody else. Okay? And so this particular system is not only incredibly
1:26:35
energy efficient and there's one other thing that's incredible because of the nature of the workload of
1:26:42
AI it spikes instantaneously with this computation layer called all
1:26:47
reduce the amount of current the amount of energy that is used sp simultaneously
1:26:54
is really off the charts oftentimes it'll spike up 25%. We now have power
1:26:59
smoothing across the entire system so that you don't have to overprovision by
1:27:05
25 times or if you overprovision by 25 times you don't have to leave 25 times
1:27:11
25% not 25 times 25% of the energy um
1:27:17
squandered or unused and so now you could fill up the entire power budget
1:27:22
and you don't have to over you don't have to proceed you don't have to provision beyond that and then the Last
1:27:28
thing of course is performance. So let's take a look at the performance of this. These are only charts that people who
1:27:34
build AI super supercomputers would love. It took exact it took every single
1:27:39
one of these chips complete redesign of every single one of the systems and rewriting the entire stack for us to
1:27:45
make this possible. Basically this is training the AI model. This
1:27:50
first column, the faster you train AI models, the faster you can get the next
1:27:56
frontier out to the world. This is your time to market. This is technology leadership. This is your pricing power.
1:28:02
And so in the case of the green, this is essentially
1:28:08
a 10 trillion parameter model. We scaled it up from deepse. That's why we call it
1:28:14
deepseat++. A training a 10 trillion parameter model on a 100 trillion
1:28:20
tokens. Okay. And that's this is our simulation projection of what it would
1:28:25
take for us to build the next frontier model. The next frontier model uh Elon's already mentioned that the next version
1:28:31
of Grock Grock 5 I think is 7 trillion parameters. So this is 10 and in the green is black. Well, and here in the
1:28:39
case of um uh Reuben, notice the throughput is so much higher and
1:28:46
therefore it only takes 1/4th as many of these systems in order to train the
1:28:52
model in the time that we gave it here which is one month. Okay. And so time
1:28:58
time is the same for everybody. Now how much how fast you can train that model and how large of a model you can train
1:29:04
is how you're going to get to the frontier first. The second part is your factory throughput.
1:29:10
Blackwell is green again. And factory throughput is important because your factory is in the case of a gigawatt is
1:29:17
$50 billion. A $50 billion data center
1:29:22
can only consume one gawatt of power. And so if your performance,
1:29:29
your throughput per watt is very good versus quite poor, that directly
1:29:35
translates to your revenues. Your revenues of your data center is directly
1:29:41
related to the second second column. And in the case of Blackwell, it was about
1:29:46
10 times over Hopper. In the case of Reuben, it's going to be about 10 times higher again. Okay. And in the case of
1:29:53
now the um the cost of the tokens, how
1:29:58
cost effectively it is to generate the token. This is Reuben about onetenth
1:30:04
just as in the case of Yep.
1:30:12
So that's how this is how we're going to get everybody to the next frontier to um push AI to the next level and of
1:30:21
course to build these data centers energy efficiently and costefficiently.
1:30:26
So this is it. This is Nvidia today. You know, we mentioned that we build chips,
1:30:33
but as you know, Nvidia builds entire systems now. And AI is a full stack. We
1:30:40
we're reinventing AI across everything from chips to infrastructure to models
1:30:46
to applications. And our job is to create the entire stack so that all of you could create incredible applications
1:30:53
uh for the rest of the world. Thank you all for coming. Have a great CES. Now,
1:31:00
before before I before I let you guys go, uh there were a whole bunch of slides we have to cut we had to leave on
1:31:06
the cutting floor and so we have some out takes here. I think it'll be fun for you. Have a great see us, guys.
1:31:17
And cut Nvidia live at CES. Take four marker.
1:31:25
Boom. like action.
1:31:30
Sorry guys. Platform shift, huh? [Music]
1:31:37
That should do it. And let's roll camera. [Music]
1:31:43
A shade of green. A bright happy green. World's most powerful AI supercomput you
1:31:51
can plug into the wall next to my toaster.
1:31:57
Hey guys, I'm I'm stuck again. I'm so sorry. This slide is never going to work. Let's just cut it. Hello. Can you hear me?
1:32:07
So, like I was saying, the router. Because not every problem needs the biggest, smartest model. Just the right
1:32:14
one. No. No, don't lose any of them. This new six chip Reuben platform makes
1:32:22
one amazing AI supercomputer. There you go, little guy. Oh no, no, not
1:32:30
the scaling laws. There is a squirrel on the car. Be ready to make the squirrel go away. Ask the
1:32:36
squirrel gently to move away. Did you know the best models today are all mixture of experts?
1:32:45
Hey, [Music] [Applause] [Music]
1:32:54
[Music] where'd everybody go?
1:33:02
[Music]
1:33:16
[Music]
