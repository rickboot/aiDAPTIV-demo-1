DRAM MARKET ALERT: Q1 2026 PRICE SURGE ACCELERATES
TrendForce Market Analysis | January 6, 2026

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The DRAM market is experiencing unprecedented price acceleration in Q1 2026, driven by AI infrastructure demand and strategic capacity reallocation by memory manufacturers. Contract prices are forecast to rise 55-60% quarter-over-quarter, with server DRAM potentially exceeding 60% increases.

KEY FINDINGS:

SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS:
- SK Hynix reports HBM, DRAM, and NAND capacity "essentially sold out" for 2026
- Memory manufacturers prioritizing high-margin HBM production over conventional DRAM
- HBM production consumes significantly more wafer capacity per gigabyte than standard DRAM
- Cloud service providers securing significant capacity, intensifying supply squeeze

PRICE TRAJECTORY:
- Q1 2026 contract prices: +55-60% QoQ (conventional DRAM)
- Server DRAM: +60%+ QoQ
- Overall memory prices approaching 2x of 2018 peak levels
- Samsung raising contract prices up to 60% for certain memory chips

IMPACT ON END MARKETS:

Consumer Electronics:
- Smartphone and PC markets facing higher device costs
- OEMs considering specification downgrades to manage BOM costs
- Some manufacturers maintaining current RAM specs rather than upgrading
- Average selling prices for devices expected to rise significantly

Enterprise IT:
- Enterprise IT costs rising sharply as traditional DRAM supply diminishes
- Data center operators facing budget pressures
- Cloud providers passing costs to customers

AI Infrastructure:
- AI servers requiring exponentially more memory per system
- Enterprise environments pulling disproportionate share of global capacity
- Memory becoming primary cost driver in AI deployments

DURATION OUTLOOK:
Analysts characterize this as a "memory supercycle" driven by structural (not cyclical) capacity reallocation. Supply constraints expected to persist through 2027, with some forecasts extending into 2028.

MANUFACTURER STRATEGIES:
Memory producers exercising discipline in capacity expansion following 2022 downturn. Focus on higher-margin products (HBM for AI) reducing availability for consumer/enterprise segments.

MARKET IMPLICATIONS:
The shift represents a fundamental reshaping of the global memory market. Traditional DRAM buyers face sustained period of high prices and limited availability as AI infrastructure consumes growing share of production capacity.
